# Littering behavior simulation

[The simulation](https://grohom.github.io/littering/)

## Setting

- In a park there are 200 agents wandering aimlessly. You are one of these agents.
- An agent has a circular field of view with radius 20 pixels.
- When nobody sees it, an agent litters with some probability (initially set to 5%).
- A piece of litter decomposes with probability 2% in each time step.
- If an agent sees litter, it is unhappy. Otherwise it is happy.
- Your average happiness is graphed orange.
- The population littering probability is green.
- Your littering probability is blue.

## What to study

Note your average happines after the system reaches a steady state. Try to change your littering probability and see how it influences your happiness.

Is it rational to conclude "If I litter less, I will be happier"?

Now try changing the others' littering probability.

What is the rational course of action (assuming that you want to be happier)?

Remember that in this setting littering is anonymous -- no one sees and no one knows who litters.
